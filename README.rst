Link Rottie
===========

A very good dog who fetches! Because "the cloud" is just someone else's
computer.

Link Rottie, (Link Rottweiler if you're feeling formal) takes your GitHub repos 
and backs them up locally.  It takes your git submodules in the cloud, and 
backs them up locally.  It takes anything for which the only authoritative 
version seems to live somewhere you don't own, and it backs it up locally on 
something you do.
