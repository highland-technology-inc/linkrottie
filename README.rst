Link Rottie
===========

A very good dog who fetches! Because "the cloud" is just someone else's
computer!

Link Rottie, (or Link Rotweiler if you're feeling formal) takes your GitHub
repos and backs them up locally.  It takes your git submodules in the cloud,
and backs them up locally.  It takes anything for which the only authoritative
version seems to live somewhere you don't own, and it backs it up locally on
something you do.
